Welcome to the Jazz documentation!

**Note:** We just released [Jazz 0.14.0](/docs/upgrade/0-14-0) with a bunch of breaking changes and are still cleaning the docs up - see the [upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade/0-14-0) for details.

## Quickstart

You can use [`create-jazz-app`](/docs/tools/create-jazz-app) to create a new Jazz project from one of our starter templates or example apps:

<CodeGroup>
```sh
npx create-jazz-app@latest --api-key you@example.com
```
</CodeGroup>

Or set up Jazz yourself, using the following instructions for your framework of choice:

- [React](/docs/react/project-setup)
- [Next.js](/docs/react/project-setup#nextjs)
- [React Native](/docs/react-native/project-setup)
- [React Native Expo](/docs/react-native-expo/project-setup)
- [Vue](/docs/vue/project-setup)
- [Svelte](/docs/svelte/project-setup)

{/* <ContentByFramework framework="react">
  Or you can follow this [React step-by-step guide](/docs/react/guide) where we walk you through building an issue tracker app.
</ContentByFramework> */}

## Example apps

You can also find [example apps](/examples) with code most similar to what you want to build. These apps
make use of different features such as auth, file upload, and more.

## Sync and storage

Sync and persist your data by setting up a [sync and storage infrastructure](/docs/sync-and-storage) using Jazz Cloud, or do it yourself.

## Collaborative values

Learn how to structure your data using [collaborative values](/docs/schemas/covalues).
