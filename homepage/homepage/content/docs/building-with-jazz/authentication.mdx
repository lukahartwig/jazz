# Authentication

Authentication is how users identify themselves to your Jazz application. It enables users to access their [accounts](/docs/building-with-jazz/accounts) across multiple devices and collaborate with others.

## Understanding Authentication in Jazz

In Jazz, authentication is based on cryptographic keys that securely identify users. These keys work like digital signatures:

- The **public part** represents a user's identity and can be shared
- The **private part** (or secret) proves ownership of that identity

This approach provides strong security while enabling seamless collaboration across devices.

## Authentication States

Jazz provides three distinct authentication states that determine how users interact with your application:
- [Anonymous Authentication](#anonymous-authentication)
- [Authenticated Account](#authenticated-account)
- [Guest Mode](#guest-mode)

For implementation details, code examples, and state detection patterns, see the [Authentication States](/docs/authentication/authentication-states) reference.

### Anonymous Authentication

This is the default starting point for new users. Jazz automatically creates a local account when someone first visits your application. With anonymous authentication:

- Data persists only on the current device
- Users can create and edit content immediately
- Their work can be upgraded to a full account later

This approach enables a frictionless onboarding experience, allowing users to start using your application without immediately signing up. You can [detect this state](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#detecting-authentication-state) in your application using Jazz's hooks.

### Authenticated Account

Once a user creates a full account, they enter the authenticated state. With an authenticated account:

- Data synchronizes across all their devices
- Users can collaborate with others
- Their identity is consistent across sessions

Authenticated accounts are the foundation of collaborative applications, enabling real-time data synchronization across devices and between users. You can [configure sync behavior](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#controlling-sync-for-different-authentication-states) based on authentication state through the Jazz provider.

### Guest Mode

Applications can also offer a guest mode that provides read-only access without creating any account. In guest mode:

- Users can browse public content
- No data is saved or synchronized
- No identity is established

Guest mode is ideal for users who just want to view content without creating an account. This mode can be enabled or disabled through [provider configuration](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#configuring-guest-mode-access).

## Authentication Flow

Understanding the flow between authentication states helps you design a smooth user experience:

1. **First Visit**: Users start in **anonymous authentication** with a new local account
2. **Registration**: When users register, their anonymous account is upgraded to **authenticated**
3. **Logout**: When users log out, they return to **anonymous authentication** with a new account
4. **Login**: When users log in again, they access their **authenticated** account

This flow is designed to create a seamless experience. When users upgrade from anonymous to authenticated accounts, Jazz provides mechanisms to [migrate their data](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#migrating-data-from-anonymous-to-authenticated-account) through the `onAnonymousAccountDiscarded` handler, ensuring no work is lost during authentication transitions.

## Authentication Methods

Jazz offers several authentication methods to suit different needs:

### Passkeys

Passkeys use biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) and device security to provide a passwordless experience:

- **Advantages**: Highly secure, easy to use, no passwords to remember
- **Best for**: Modern applications with security-conscious users
- **Limitations**: Requires platform support (most modern browsers and devices)

### Passphrases

Passphrases provide a recovery method using a sequence of words:

- **Advantages**: Works across all platforms, user-controlled recovery
- **Best for**: Applications where users may need manual account recovery
- **Limitations**: Users must securely store their passphrase

### Third-Party Authentication

Jazz supports integration with authentication providers like Clerk:

- **Advantages**: Offers social login options (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Best for**: Applications where users expect social login options
- **Limitations**: Depends on external service availability

## Choosing Authentication Methods

When designing your application, consider offering multiple authentication methods to accommodate different user preferences and scenarios:

- Passkeys for primary authentication
- Passphrases as a recovery method
- Third-party options for ease of onboarding

The right combination depends on your user base and application requirements.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand authentication, you're ready to learn about [Groups and Ownership](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups) - Jazz's system for managing permissions and sharing content between users.
