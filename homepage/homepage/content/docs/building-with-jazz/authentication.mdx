# Authentication

Authentication is how users identify themselves to your Jazz application. It enables users to access their accounts across multiple devices and collaborate with others.

## Understanding Authentication in Jazz

In Jazz, authentication is based on cryptographic keys that securely identify users. These keys work like digital signatures:

- The **public part** represents a user's identity and can be shared
- The **private part** (or secret) proves ownership of that identity

This approach provides strong security while enabling seamless collaboration across devices.

## Authentication States

When a user interacts with your Jazz application, they can be in one of three states:

### Anonymous Authentication

This is the default starting point for new users. Jazz automatically creates a local account when someone first visits your application. With anonymous authentication:

- Data persists only on the current device
- Users can create and edit content immediately
- Their work can be upgraded to a full account later

This approach enables a frictionless onboarding experience, allowing users to start using your application without immediately signing up.

### Authenticated Account

Once a user creates a full account, they enter the authenticated state. With an authenticated account:

- Data synchronizes across all their devices
- Users can collaborate with others
- Their identity is consistent across sessions

Authenticated accounts are the foundation of collaborative applications, enabling real-time data synchronization across devices and between users.

### Guest Mode

Applications can also offer a guest mode that provides read-only access without creating any account. In guest mode:

- Users can browse public content
- No data is saved or synchronized
- No identity is established

Guest mode is ideal for users who just want to view content without creating an account.

## Authentication Flow

Understanding the flow between authentication states helps you design a smooth user experience:

1. **First Visit**: Users start in anonymous authentication with a new local account
2. **Registration**: When users register, their anonymous account is upgraded to authenticated
3. **Logout**: When users log out, they return to anonymous authentication with a new account
4. **Login**: When users log in again, they access their authenticated account

This flow preserves user data during transitions and creates a seamless experience.

## Authentication Methods

Jazz offers several authentication methods to suit different needs:

### Passkeys

Passkeys use biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) and device security to provide a passwordless experience:

- **Advantages**: Highly secure, easy to use, no passwords to remember
- **Best for**: Modern applications with security-conscious users
- **Limitations**: Requires platform support (most modern browsers and devices)

### Passphrases

Passphrases provide a recovery method using a sequence of words:

- **Advantages**: Works across all platforms, user-controlled recovery
- **Best for**: Applications where users may need manual account recovery
- **Limitations**: Users must securely store their passphrase

### Third-Party Authentication

Jazz supports integration with authentication providers like Clerk:

- **Advantages**: Offers social login options (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Best for**: Applications where users expect social login options
- **Limitations**: Depends on external service availability

## Choosing Authentication Methods

When designing your application, consider offering multiple authentication methods to accommodate different user preferences and scenarios:

- Passkeys for primary authentication
- Passphrases as a recovery method
- Third-party options for ease of onboarding

The right combination depends on your user base and application requirements.
