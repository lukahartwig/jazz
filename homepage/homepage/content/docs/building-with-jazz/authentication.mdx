# Authentication

Authentication is how your users prove who they are to Jazz, turning anonymous visitors into known collaborators.

Now that you've set up [Accounts](/docs/building-with-jazz/accounts), it's time to connect real people to them. We'll explore **authentication states**, **authentication methods**, and how to create a smooth experience that works **even when users are offline**.

## What is Authentication in Jazz?

Think of Jazz authentication as a digital handshake between your users and their data. Unlike traditional password systems, Jazz uses secure cryptographic keys:

- The **public key** is like your user's digital name tag that everyone can see
- The **private key** is like their secret handshake that proves it's really them

This approach makes your app both highly secure and delightfully user-friendly. No more forgotten passwords or complex security questions!

For more details on how Jazz's cryptographic authentication works under the hood, see [Authentication Security](/docs/authentication/security).

## The Three Authentication States

Jazz gives users three different ways to exist in your application:

### Anonymous Mode: Try Before You Sign Up

When someone first opens your app, they get an anonymous account automatically. It's like being given a visitor badge at a conference:

- They can start creating content immediately
- Their work stays on their current device
- Everything they create can be upgraded to a full account later

This creates a "no-friction" first experience - users can start using your app without signing up first.

Learn how to [detect when users are in anonymous mode](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#detecting-authentication-state) in your application code.

### Authenticated: Full Access Everywhere

Once users create a proper account, they enter authenticated mode. This is like having a permanent membership card:

- Their data syncs across all their devices
- They can collaborate with other users
- Their identity remains consistent across sessions

This is the ideal state for regular users of your application.

See how to [implement authenticated accounts](/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-flow) in your Jazz application.

### Guest Mode: Just Browsing

Some applications also offer a guest mode for users who just want to view content. It's like window shopping:

- Users can browse public content
- Nothing gets saved or synchronized
- No identity or account is created

This is perfect for applications where some content should be publicly viewable without requiring an account.

Learn how to [configure guest mode access](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#configuring-guest-mode-access) in your application.

## The User's Journey

Here's how users typically move through your authentication system:

1. They start as **anonymous** users on their first visit
2. When they sign up, they become **authenticated** users
3. If they log out, they return to being **anonymous** (with a new account)
4. When they log back in, they regain access to their **authenticated** account

The best part? When users upgrade from anonymous to authenticated, Jazz helps you migrate their work automatically, so nothing gets lost in the transition.

See a complete example of [migrating data between accounts](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#migrating-data-from-anonymous-to-authenticated-account) when users authenticate.

## Choosing Your Authentication Methods

Jazz offers several ways for users to prove their identity:

- **Passkeys**: The modern approach using TouchID/FaceID - super secure and convenient (but needs device support)
- **Passphrases**: A sequence of words that works everywhere, even offline (but users need to remember them)
- **Clerk Integration**: Traditional logins with email/password, Google, GitHub, etc. (familiar but requires internet)

Most apps should offer multiple methods to cover different scenarios. We recommend:

- **Passkeys as your primary method** (for the best security and user experience)
- Passphrases as a backup option (for devices without biometric support)
- Jazz Cloud or Clerk for apps that need traditional social logins

Explore the [complete list of authentication methods](/docs/authentication/overview#available-authentication-methods) available in Jazz.

## Next Steps

With authentication in place, let's explore [Groups and Ownership](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups) to control who can access what data.
