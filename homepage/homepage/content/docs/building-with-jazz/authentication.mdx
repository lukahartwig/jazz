# Authentication

Authentication connects users to their Jazz accounts, enabling personalized collaboration.

Now that you've set up [Accounts](/docs/building-with-jazz/accounts), connect users to them. We'll explore **authentication states**, **authentication methods**, and **offline experiences**.

## What is Authentication in Jazz?

Jazz authentication uses cryptographic keys instead of traditional passwords:

- **Public key**: User's visible digital identity
- **Private key**: Secure proof of identity

This approach provides security without password complexity.

See [Authentication Security](/docs/authentication/security) for technical details.

## Authentication States

Jazz provides three user states:

### Anonymous Mode

New users receive anonymous accounts automatically:

- Immediate content creation
- Device-local storage
- Upgradeable to full accounts

This enables friction-free onboarding.

See [detecting authentication state](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#detecting-authentication-state) for implementation.

### Authenticated Mode

Users with full accounts get:

- Cross-device data sync
- Collaboration capabilities
- Persistent identity

This is the target state for regular users.

See [authentication flow implementation](/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-flow).

### Guest Mode

Optional guest access for viewing:

- Browse public content
- No data persistence
- No account creation

Useful for public content viewing.

See [guest mode configuration](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#configuring-guest-mode-access).

## User Journey

Typical authentication flow:

1. Start as **anonymous** user
2. Sign up to become **authenticated**
3. Log out returns to **anonymous** (new account)
4. Log in restores **authenticated** access

Jazz automatically migrates data when upgrading from anonymous to authenticated.

See [account migration examples](/docs/authentication/authentication-states#migrating-data-from-anonymous-to-authenticated-account).

## Authentication Methods

Available authentication options:

- **Passkeys**: TouchID/FaceID biometric authentication (requires device support)
- **Passphrases**: Word sequences that work offline (requires memorization)
- **Clerk Integration**: Traditional email/password and social logins (requires internet)

Recommended approach:

- **Primary**: Passkeys for security and convenience
- **Backup**: Passphrases for broader device support
- **Traditional**: Clerk for familiar social login patterns

See [available authentication methods](/docs/authentication/overview#available-authentication-methods).

## Next Steps

With authentication in place, let's explore [Groups and Ownership](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups) to control who can access what data.
