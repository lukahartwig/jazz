# Server Workers

Server Workers are like robot assistants that do behind-the-scenes work for your Jazz app, connecting to external services and handling complex tasks.

Now that you've explored [Sync](/docs/building-with-jazz/sync), it's time to discover the power of server-side functionality. We'll look at how Server Workers act as **automated team members** in your collaborative space, implement powerful **integration patterns**, and extend your app with **backend capabilities** while maintaining Jazz's magical collaboration model.

## What Are Server Workers?

Think of Server Workers as AI teammates that join your collaborative workspace. While your human users collaborate through their devices, Server Workers join the party from the cloud. They're special because:

- They have their own **identity** in your system, just like a regular user
- They can **read and write data** based on the permissions you give them
- They **watch for changes** and respond automatically
- They run on servers instead of browsers (Node.js, Cloudflare Workers, etc.)

The beautiful insight here is that **Server Workers aren't a separate system** - they're just another kind of collaborator in your app. It's like having a robot friend who's always ready to help your human users!

Learn more about setting up server workers in the [Node.JS / Server Workers guide](/docs/project-setup/server-side).

## When Your App Needs Server Workers

Server Workers shine in these situations:

- **Secret Keeping**: When you need to use API keys that shouldn't be exposed to browsers
- **Heavy Lifting**: For intensive calculations that would slow down your user's device
- **External Connections**: To talk to databases, payment processors, or other services
- **Automation Magic**: Creating workflows that happen automatically when data changes
- **Rule Enforcement**: Ensuring important business rules are always followed
- **Background Processing**: Handling time-consuming tasks without making users wait

Instead of building a completely separate backend like in traditional apps, Server Workers let you extend your Jazz app with server powers while keeping everything in harmony.

## The Collaboration Model

What makes Server Workers special is their unique approach to collaboration with your users through shared data:

- **Shared Task Boards**: Humans and Server Workers both update the same CoValues
- **Automatic Reactions**: Server Workers spring into action when users make changes
- **Invisible Integration**: Results flow back to users without them needing to refresh

This feels much more natural than the old request-response model. Instead of humans shouting requests at a server and waiting for answers, everyone (humans and Server Workers) collaborates on the same digital workspace.

## How Server Workers Join Your Team

Server Workers become part of your app in three key ways:

### Digital Identity

Each Server Worker gets its own account and identity:

- A stable **ID** for identification (like "payment-processor" or "email-sender")
- A secure **authentication key** for security
- A presence in **edit history** so you can track their actions

### Permission Management

Server Workers use the same permission system as human users:

- Add them to **Groups** to control what they can access
- Assign **roles** (reader, writer, admin) based on what they need to do
- **Share specific data** with them just like you would with teammates

This unified approach means your security model stays clean and consistent.

Check out [Node.JS / Server Workers](/docs/project-setup/server-side) for implementation details.

### Always-On Attention

Server Workers stay vigilant by subscribing to data changes:

1. They **watch specific data** you tell them to monitor
2. When changes happen, they **spring into action**
3. They **update the same workspace** with results

This creates a smooth, continuous flow of information between users and servers.

## Powerful Server Worker Patterns

Here are two game-changing patterns you can implement:

### The State Machine Pattern

This popular pattern turns CoValues into processing pipelines:

1. A user changes a document's status to "ready for processing"
2. The Server Worker notices this status change
3. It runs its processing magic (maybe generating a PDF or analyzing text)
4. It updates the document with results and changes status to "processed"

This creates a natural, asynchronous workflow between humans and servers.

### The Bridge to the Outside World

Server Workers can connect your Jazz world to external services:

1. They keep an eye on "outbound request" CoValues
2. When a new request appears, they call external APIs
3. They bring the results back into your Jazz app for users to see

This lets your Jazz app talk to anything on the internet without exposing secrets to the browser.
