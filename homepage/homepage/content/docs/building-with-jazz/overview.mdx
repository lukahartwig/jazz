# Overview

Building with Jazz is straightforward. Jazz handles real-time collaboration, data sync, and conflict resolution automatically, so you can focus on your application logic.

We'll cover five essential concepts in order, from basic data structures to advanced authentication.

## Installation

First, you'll need Jazz installed in your project. See [Project Setup](/docs/project-setup) for detailed installation guides for React, Next.js, React Native, Svelte, Vue, and server-side setups.

For new projects, [`create-jazz-app`](/docs/tools/create-jazz-app) provides a fully configured starting point.

## What We'll Cover

1. **[Schemas](/docs/building-with-jazz/schemas)** - Define your collaborative data structure using CoMaps, CoLists, and other collaborative types

2. **[Using CoValues](/docs/building-with-jazz/using-covalues)** - Connect to the Jazz network and work with real-time collaborative data in your application

3. **[Accounts](/docs/building-with-jazz/accounts)** - Handle user identity and personal data that syncs across devices

4. **[Groups](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups)** - Control data access and enable sharing between users with permission-based collaboration

5. **[Authentication](/docs/building-with-jazz/authentication)** - Secure user access with passkeys, passphrases, or traditional auth providers

By the end, you'll understand how to build full-featured collaborative applications with real-time sync, user management, and secure data sharing.

## Beyond the Basics

Once you've mastered these concepts:

- **[Sync](/docs/building-with-jazz/sync)** - Advanced data synchronization patterns
- **[Server Workers](/docs/building-with-jazz/server-workers)** - Server-side application logic
- **[Example applications](/examples)** - See complete collaborative apps in action

## Next steps

Now that you've got a sense of what Jazz is, let's dive into the details starting with how we define our data structures with [Schemas](/docs/building-with-jazz/schemas).
