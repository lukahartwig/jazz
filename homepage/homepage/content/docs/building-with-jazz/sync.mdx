# Sync

Sync is how Jazz transfers data between users and devices, enabling real-time collaboration.

Now that you've mastered the [core concepts](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups) of Jazz, let's explore the **advanced topic** of synchronization. We'll look at how Jazz's **local-first** architecture works, different **sync options** including Jazz Cloud and self-hosted solutions, and how to configure sync for your specific needs.

## How Sync Works in Jazz

At its core, Jazz's sync system ensures that data changes made by any user are propagated to all other users who have access to that data. This happens through a combination of:

- **Local-first operations**: Changes happen immediately on the local device
- **Background synchronization**: Changes are sent to a [sync server](/docs/sync-and-storage)
- **Conflict resolution**: The CRDT nature of CoValues automatically resolves conflicts

Think of Jazz's sync system as a seamless data courier that ensures everyone sees the same state, regardless of when or where they're working.

## The Sync Journey

When a user makes a change to a CoValue in Jazz, a specific sequence of events occurs:

1. The change is **immediately applied** to the local device's state
2. The **user interface updates** to reflect the change
3. In the background, the change is **sent to a sync server**
4. The sync server **forwards the change** to all other connected devices
5. Other devices **merge the change** into their local state
6. Their **user interfaces update** to reflect the change

This process happens automatically and transparently, creating the illusion that all users are working on the same piece of data simultaneously.

## Sync Options

Jazz provides multiple options for synchronizing data:

### Jazz Cloud

The simplest option is to use [Jazz Cloud](/docs/sync-and-storage#using-jazz-cloud), a managed service that provides sync servers for you:

- **Real-time synchronization** between users and devices
- **Persistent storage** with redundancy and backups
- **Distributed caching** for low-latency access
- **Zero configuration** for quick application development

Jazz Cloud is ideal for teams who want to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

### Self-Hosted Sync Server

For those with specific requirements, Jazz allows you to [run your own sync server](/docs/sync-and-storage#running-your-own-sync-server):

- **Complete control** over your data and infrastructure
- **On-premises deployment** for compliance requirements
- **Custom configurations** for specific performance needs
- **Private networks** for heightened security

Running your own sync server gives you maximum flexibility but requires more setup and maintenance.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how data synchronization works, you can explore [Server Workers](/docs/building-with-jazz/server-workers) to add server-side logic to your Jazz application, or return to [building your app](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups#next-steps) with what you've learned so far.
