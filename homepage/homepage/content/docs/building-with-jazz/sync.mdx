# Sync

Sync enables data transfer between users and devices in Jazz applications.

Now that you've mastered the [core concepts](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups), explore synchronization. We'll cover Jazz's **local-first** architecture, **sync options** including Jazz Cloud and self-hosted solutions, and **configuration** for specific needs.

## How Sync Works in Jazz

Jazz's sync system ensures data consistency across all users and devices. When changes occur:

- **Local-first operations**: Changes apply immediately to the local device
- **Background sync**: Changes send to a [sync server](/docs/sync-and-storage)
- **Conflict resolution**: CRDT architecture automatically resolves conflicts

This process maintains data harmony regardless of when or where users work.

## The Sync Process

When someone modifies a CoValue:

1. Change **applies immediately** to local device state
2. **User interface updates** to reflect the change
3. Change **sends to sync server** in background
4. Sync server **forwards change** to connected devices
5. Other devices **merge the change** into local state
6. Their **interfaces update** to show the change

This process happens automatically and provides seamless collaboration.

## Sync Options

Jazz provides two sync approaches:

### Jazz Cloud

[Jazz Cloud](/docs/sync-and-storage#using-jazz-cloud) provides ready-to-use sync infrastructure:

- **Real-time sync** between users and devices
- **Persistent storage** with redundancy and backups
- **Distributed caching** for low-latency access
- **Zero configuration** for rapid development

Jazz Cloud is optimal for teams focused on features rather than infrastructure management.

### Self-Hosted Sync Server

[Run your own sync server](/docs/sync-and-storage#running-your-own-sync-server) for maximum control:

- **Complete control** over data and infrastructure
- **On-premises deployment** for compliance requirements
- **Custom configurations** for specific performance needs
- **Private networks** for enhanced security

Self-hosting provides flexibility but requires setup and maintenance.

## Next Steps

Choose your path:

- [Server Workers](/docs/building-with-jazz/server-workers) - Add server-side logic to your application
- Return to [building your app](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups#next-steps) with core Jazz concepts

Both paths lead to creating collaborative experiences.
