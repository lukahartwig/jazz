# Sync

Sync is how Jazz transfers data between users and devices, enabling real-time collaboration.

Now that you've mastered the [core concepts](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups) of Jazz, let's explore the **advanced topic** of synchronization. We'll look at how Jazz's **local-first** architecture works, different **sync options** including Jazz Cloud and self-hosted solutions, and how to configure sync for your specific needs.

## How Sync Works in Jazz

At its core, Jazz's sync system is like a magical courier service that ensures everyone sees the same information, no matter where they are. When any user makes a change, three things happen:

- **Local-first operations**: Changes happen immediately on the local device
- **Background synchronization**: Changes are sent to a [sync server](/docs/sync-and-storage)
- **Conflict resolution**: The CRDT nature of CoValues automatically resolves conflicts

Think of Jazz's sync system as a team of invisible assistants working behind the scenes to keep everyone's data in harmony, regardless of when or where they're working.

## The Sync Journey

When someone changes a CoValue in Jazz, a bit of magic happens behind the scenes:

1. The change is **immediately applied** to the local device's state
2. The **user interface updates** to reflect the change
3. In the background, the change is **sent to a sync server**
4. The sync server **forwards the change** to all other connected devices
5. Other devices **merge the change** into their local state
6. Their **user interfaces update** to reflect the change

This whole process happens automatically and feels like wizardry to your users - everyone sees the same data as if they were all editing the same document together, even when they're miles apart!

## Sync Options

Jazz gives you two super simple ways to keep everyone's data in sync:

### Jazz Cloud

The easiest option is to use [Jazz Cloud](/docs/sync-and-storage#using-jazz-cloud), our ready-to-go service that does all the heavy lifting for you:

- **Real-time synchronization** between users and devices
- **Persistent storage** with redundancy and backups
- **Distributed caching** for low-latency access
- **Zero configuration** for quick application development

Jazz Cloud is ideal for teams who want to focus on building amazing features rather than managing infrastructure - it's like having a team of expert DevOps engineers working for you!

### Self-Hosted Sync Server

Feel like being in the driver's seat? Jazz lets you [run your own sync server](/docs/sync-and-storage#running-your-own-sync-server) with just a single command:

- **Complete control** over your data and infrastructure
- **On-premises deployment** for compliance requirements
- **Custom configurations** for specific performance needs
- **Private networks** for heightened security

Running your own sync server gives you maximum flexibility but requires more setup and maintenance. It's perfect for the techies who like to tinker under the hood!

## Next Steps

Awesome job learning about sync! Now you can choose your own adventure:

- Dive into [Server Workers](/docs/building-with-jazz/server-workers) to add super-powered server-side logic to your app
- Head back to [building your app](/docs/building-with-jazz/groups#next-steps) with the core Jazz concepts you've already mastered

Whichever path you choose, you're well on your way to creating collaborative experiences that will delight your users!
