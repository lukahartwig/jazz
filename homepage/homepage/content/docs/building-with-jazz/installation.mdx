# Installation

Let's get Jazz up and running in your project! Installation is quick and painless, and you'll be building collaborative apps in no time.

The fastest way to start with Jazz is to use our handy [create-jazz-app](/docs/tools/create-jazz-app) command line tool. This gives you a fully configured project with everything set up and ready to go.

## Manual Installation

Already have a project? No problem! Just add the Jazz packages:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
pnpm install jazz-react jazz-tools
```
</CodeGroup>

That's it! You now have the core Jazz libraries in your project. 

## Next Steps

Now that you have Jazz installed, it's time to create your [Schemas](/docs/building-with-jazz/schemas) - the building blocks of your collaborative data model.
