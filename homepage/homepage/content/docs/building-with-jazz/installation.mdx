# Installation

Get Jazz running in your project with a few commands.

The fastest way to start is [`create-jazz-app`](/docs/tools/create-jazz-app), which creates a fully configured project.

## Manual Installation

For existing projects, add the Jazz packages:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
pnpm install jazz-react jazz-tools
```
</CodeGroup>

You now have the core Jazz libraries installed. 

## Next Steps

Now that you have Jazz installed, it's time to create your [Schemas](/docs/building-with-jazz/schemas) - the building blocks of your collaborative data model.
