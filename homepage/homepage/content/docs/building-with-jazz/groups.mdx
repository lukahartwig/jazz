# Groups and Ownership

Groups are how you control who can see and edit data in your Jazz app, turning personal notes into collaborative workspaces.

Now that you've set up [Authentication](/docs/building-with-jazz/authentication), it's time to explore how data access works in Jazz. We'll look at how **ownership** determines who data belongs to, how **groups enable sharing**, and how **permission roles** give different users different capabilities.

## What is Ownership in Jazz?

Think of ownership in Jazz like having your name on the deed to a house. Every piece of data in your app must have an owner, which can be either:

- An individual **Account** - like your private diary that only you can read
- A **Group** - like a shared whiteboard that a whole team can use

When you create something new in Jazz, you get to decide who owns it:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import { Group, co, z } from "jazz-tools";

export const Note = co.map({
  title: z.string(),
});

const teamGroup = Group.create();
// ---cut---
// Create private data (owned by the current user)
const privateNote = Note.create({ 
  title: "My Private Note"
});

// Create shared data (owned by a group)
const sharedNote = Note.create(
  { title: "Team Note" },
  teamGroup // This note is owned by the group
);
```
</CodeGroup>

This ownership concept is the foundation of Jazz's permission system, controlling who can access what across your entire application.

Learn more about how ownership works in [Groups as Permission Scopes](/docs/groups/intro#ownership).

## Groups: The Magic Behind Sharing

Groups in Jazz are like magical access passes that determine who gets to enter different rooms in your data castle. They're super lightweight but incredibly powerful, letting you:

- Control exactly who can see your data
- Decide what actions different people can take
- Share content with specific individuals or everyone
- Build complex organizational structures

The best part? Groups are so lightweight that you can create thousands of them without worrying about performance - one for each document, project, team, or whatever your app needs.

See how to create and manage groups in the [Group Management documentation](/docs/groups/intro).

## The Three Permission Roles

Jazz keeps permissions simple with three fundamental roles:

- **Reader**: Can look but not touch (view-only access)
- **Writer**: Can make changes but not invite others
- **Admin**: The VIP pass - can edit content and manage who has access

This simple trio of roles covers most collaboration scenarios while keeping your code clean and straightforward.

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import { Group, co, z } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from "jazz-tools/testing";

const projectGroup = Group.create();
const documentGroup = Group.create();
const alice = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
// Give Alice writer access to the project
projectGroup.addMember(alice, "writer");

// Make content public (everyone can read)
documentGroup.addMember("everyone", "reader");
```
</CodeGroup>

Learn about implementing different permission levels in [Group Roles](/docs/groups/intro#roles).

## Collaboration Made Easy

Groups are the secret sauce of collaboration in Jazz. They enable:

- **Seamless Sharing**: Add someone to a group, and they instantly get access
- **Public Content**: Use the special `"everyone"` member for public access
- **Fine-grained Control**: Different users can have different permission levels
- **Nested Structures**: Create org charts with inherited permissions

Jazz gives you several user-friendly ways to share content:

- **Direct Sharing**: Add specific people by their account ID
- **Public Links**: Make content accessible to everyone with a single switch
- **Invite Links**: Generate special links users can click to gain access

These options let you create familiar sharing experiences like those in Google Docs or Figma, where sharing feels natural and intuitive. Without Groups, each piece of data would be a lonely island. With Groups, your app becomes a bustling collaborative community.

See examples of implementing sharing features in [Public Sharing and Invites](/docs/groups/sharing).

## Working with Shared Data

The beauty of Jazz's permission system is that it's completely invisible in your code. You access shared data exactly the same way as private data:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";

export const Document = co.map({
  title: z.string(),
});

const documentId = "co_z123";
// ---cut---
// Access data - permissions are handled automatically
const document = await Document.load(documentId);

// If you have access, you can read and modify
if (document) {
  // Will succeed if you have writer access
  document.title = "New Title"; 
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Behind the scenes, Jazz handles all the permission checks, only allowing operations the current user is authorized to perform.

## Building Organizational Structures

For more complex apps, you can create permission hierarchies that mirror real-world structures:

- Company â†’ Department â†’ Team â†’ Project

Groups can inherit from other groups, so changing permissions at one level automatically updates all the levels below it:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
// Create a hierarchy
const teamGroup = Group.create();
const projectGroup = Group.create();

// Project inherits from team
projectGroup.extend(teamGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

This inheritance model makes it easy to implement enterprise-grade permission systems with minimal code.

## Next Steps

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've completed the core journey of building applications with Jazz!

You now understand all the essential building blocks:
- **Schemas** define your data structure
- **Providers** connect your app to Jazz
- **Accounts** represent user identity
- **Authentication** secures user access
- **Groups** manage permissions and sharing

With this knowledge, you're ready to build collaborative applications that work seamlessly across devices.
