# Groups and Ownership

Groups are how you control who can see and edit data in your Jazz app, turning personal notes into collaborative workspaces.

Now that you've set up [Authentication](/docs/building-with-jazz/authentication), it's time to explore how data access works in Jazz. We'll look at how **ownership** determines who data belongs to, how **groups enable sharing**, and how **permission roles** give different users different capabilities.

## What is Ownership in Jazz?

Ownership in Jazz determines data access control. Every piece of data requires an owner:

- **Individual Account** - Private data accessible only to the owner
- **Group** - Shared data accessible to group members

Ownership is set during data creation:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import { Group, co, z } from "jazz-tools";

export const Note = co.map({
  title: z.string(),
});

const teamGroup = Group.create();
// ---cut---
// Create private data (owned by the current user)
const privateNote = Note.create({ 
  title: "My Private Note"
});

// Create shared data (owned by a group)
const sharedNote = Note.create(
  { title: "Team Note" },
  teamGroup // This note is owned by the group
);
```
</CodeGroup>

Ownership forms the foundation of Jazz's permission system.

See [Groups as Permission Scopes](/docs/groups/intro#ownership) for details.

## Groups: Enabling Data Sharing

Groups in Jazz control data access and enable collaboration. They provide:

- Precise access control
- Role-based permissions
- Content sharing capabilities
- Organizational structures

Groups are lightweight - create thousands without performance concerns.

See [Group Management](/docs/groups/intro) for implementation details.

## Permission Roles

Jazz uses three permission levels:

- **Reader**: View-only access
- **Writer**: Edit content, no member management
- **Admin**: Full control including member management

These roles cover most collaboration scenarios:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
import { Group, co, z } from "jazz-tools";
import { createJazzTestAccount } from "jazz-tools/testing";

const projectGroup = Group.create();
const documentGroup = Group.create();
const alice = await createJazzTestAccount();
// ---cut---
// Give Alice writer access to the project
projectGroup.addMember(alice, "writer");

// Make content public (everyone can read)
documentGroup.addMember("everyone", "reader");
```
</CodeGroup>

See [Group Roles](/docs/groups/intro#roles) for implementation.

## Collaboration Features

Groups enable several sharing patterns:

- **Direct sharing**: Add specific users by account ID
- **Public access**: Use `"everyone"` member for public content
- **Fine-grained control**: Different permission levels per user
- **Hierarchical structures**: Nested permission inheritance

Sharing options support familiar user experiences similar to Google Docs or Figma.

See [Public Sharing and Invites](/docs/groups/sharing) for examples.

## Working with Shared Data

Jazz handles permissions transparently in your code. Access shared data the same way as private data:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";

export const Document = co.map({
  title: z.string(),
});

const documentId = "co_z123";
// ---cut---
// Access data - permissions are handled automatically
const document = await Document.load(documentId);

// If you have access, you can read and modify
if (document) {
  // Will succeed if you have writer access
  document.title = "New Title"; 
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Jazz automatically handles permission checks, allowing only authorized operations.

See [Subscription and Loading](/docs/react/using-covalues/subscription-and-loading) for data access patterns.

## Organizational Structures

For complex applications, create permission hierarchies:

- Company → Department → Team → Project

Groups support inheritance, so permission changes propagate through the hierarchy:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group } from "jazz-tools";
// ---cut---
// Create a hierarchy
const teamGroup = Group.create();
const projectGroup = Group.create();

// Project inherits from team
projectGroup.extend(teamGroup);
```
</CodeGroup>

This inheritance model enables enterprise-grade permission systems with minimal code.

See [Group Inheritance](/docs/groups/inheritance) for advanced patterns.

## Next Steps

**Congratulations!** You've completed the core Jazz concepts:
- **Schemas** define data structure
- **Providers** connect to Jazz
- **Accounts** represent user identity
- **Authentication** secures access
- **Groups** manage permissions

You're ready to build collaborative applications.
