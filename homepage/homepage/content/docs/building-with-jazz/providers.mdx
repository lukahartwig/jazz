# Providers

After defining your schema, the next step is connecting your application to the Jazz network. This is where Providers come in.

## What are Providers?

Providers are components that connect your application to Jazz's collaborative infrastructure. They sit at the top of your application and make your schemas available throughout your component tree.

In Jazz, providers handle several critical functions:

- **Data Synchronization**: They manage connections to the Jazz network, ensuring data stays in sync across devices
- **Local Storage**: They persist data between sessions, so users don't lose their work
- **Schema Registration**: They make your schemas available to the rest of your application
- **Authentication**: They connect user accounts to your data, enabling multi-device access

## Provider Structure

Here's a simple example of a provider in a React application:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx twoslash
// @filename: schema.ts
import { Account, co } from "jazz-tools";

export class MyAppAccount extends Account {
  name = co.string;
}

// @filename: app.tsx
import * as React from "react";
// ---cut---
// App.tsx
import { JazzProvider } from "jazz-react";
import { MyAppAccount } from "./schema";

export function AppWrapper({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <JazzProvider
      // Connect to the Jazz network
      sync={{ 
        peer: "wss://cloud.jazz.tools/?key=your-api-key"
      }}
      // Register your account schema
      AccountSchema={MyAppAccount}
    >
      {children}
    </JazzProvider>
  );
}

// Register your schema for TypeScript
declare module "jazz-react" {
  interface Register {
    Account: MyAppAccount;
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This provider setup accomplishes several things:

- **Network Connection**: It connects to Jazz's cloud service for data synchronization
- **Schema Registration**: It registers your `MyAppAccount` schema with Jazz
- **TypeScript Integration**: It ensures type safety when working with your account data

## How Providers Enable Collaboration

Providers are what make the "collaborative" part of Jazz possible. When you wrap your application in a provider:

1. **Data flows bidirectionally**: Changes made by any user are synchronized to all connected clients
2. **Schema consistency is enforced**: The provider ensures all clients understand your data structure
3. **Authentication is managed**: The provider connects users' identities to their data permissions

Think of providers as creating a shared, synchronized workspace for your users that's accessible from any device.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how providers connect your application to Jazz, the next step is to learn about [Accounts](/docs/building-with-jazz/accounts) - the foundation of user identity and data in Jazz.
