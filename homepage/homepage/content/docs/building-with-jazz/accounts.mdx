# Accounts

Think of Accounts as your users' digital identities in Jazz. They're the magical starting point that connects people to all their data and makes collaboration possible.

Now that you've [connected your app with Providers](/docs/building-with-jazz/providers), it's time to explore how Accounts work. We'll look at how **profiles** and **roots** structure user data, how **migrations** let you evolve your data model, and how accounts enable seamless **multi-device experiences**.

## What are Accounts?

In Jazz, an Account is like a person's digital home. It's where they:

- Store their public profile that others can see
- Keep their private data safe and organized
- Control who gets to see and edit their stuff
- Connect with others for real-time collaboration

Accounts are special schemas that act as the central hub in a web of data - everything your users create or access flows through their account.

## Account Structure

Every Account has two key parts that work together:

1. **Profile**: The public face of your user that everyone can see (think username and avatar)
2. **Root**: Their private data vault that only they can access (like notes and settings)

This split makes it super easy to manage both public and private data:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { co, z } from "jazz-tools";

// Custom root structure for private user data
export const MyAppRoot = co.map({
  notes: z.string(),
  settings: z.object({ theme: z.string() }), // Non-collaborative object
});

// Extended profile with additional fields
export const MyAppProfile = co.profile({
  name: z.string(),
  bio: z.string(),
});

// ---cut---
// Define an account with profile and root components
export const MyAppAccount = co.account({
  profile: MyAppProfile,  // Public information
  root: MyAppRoot,        // Private data
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Behind the scenes, Jazz uses this structure to build a connected graph of data, making it easy to navigate from users to everything they own or can access.

For more details on how accounts work as graph roots, see [CoValues as a graph of data rooted in accounts](/docs/schemas/accounts-and-migrations#covalues-as-a-graph-of-data-rooted-in-accounts).

## The Collaboration Magic

Accounts are what make collaboration in Jazz feel like magic. They:

1. **Keep users consistent** across phones, tablets, and computers
2. **Track who owns what** so credit goes where it's due
3. **Handle permissions** so the right people see the right things
4. **Make sharing effortless** between teams and friends

When someone creates something in your app, it automatically links to their account. This makes tracking ownership, handling permissions, and syncing across devices just work - no extra code needed!

## Evolving Accounts with Migrations

Apps change over time, and your account structure needs to keep up. Jazz makes this painless with migrations that run automatically when users log in:

<CodeGroup>
```ts twoslash
import { Group, co, z } from "jazz-tools";
  
// A new feature - bookmarks
export const Bookmark = co.map({
  url: z.string(),
  title: z.string(),
});
  
// Root data with new bookmarks field
export const MyAppRoot = co.map({
  notes: z.string(),
  bookmarks: z.optional(co.list(Bookmark)), // New field
});

export const MyAppAccount = co
  .account({
    root: MyAppRoot,
    profile: co.profile(),
});

export const MyGroup = Group.create();

// ---cut---
// Add migration support to handle schema changes
MyAppAccount.withMigration((account) => {
  // Add new fields or update existing data
  if (!account.root?.bookmarks) {
    account.root.bookmarks = co.list(Bookmark).create([], MyGroup);
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

The best part? You don't need to worry about database migrations or complicated update scripts. Jazz handles it all automatically, so everyone's data structure stays perfectly up-to-date with your latest code.

For more details on implementing migrations, see [Migrations](/docs/schemas/accounts-and-migrations#populating-and-evolving-root-and-profile-schemas-with-migrations).

## Next Steps

Now that you've got accounts figured out, let's connect users to them with [Authentication](/docs/building-with-jazz/authentication) and get your sign-up flow working.
